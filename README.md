# bandaidReact

Bandaid is a global freelancing platform where music professionals and skilled hobbyists can present their music with a description, a video link and their hourly price to be noticed by clients in search of live musicians for hire.

(First developed as a group project during a Bootcamp in Web Development, I continued to work on the project to add new design elements, authentification and a connection to MongoDB Atlas Cluster to finalize the fully deployable app.)

Tools: MERN stack

MongoDB Atlas cluster, Express, React 16.8+ Hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext, useReducer, useRef), CSS and Bootstrap, JWT (JSON Web Token) for authentication, Node.
