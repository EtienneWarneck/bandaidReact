# bandaidReact

Bandaid is a global freelancing platform where independent musicians and music professionals can present their music with a video and some description to connect with clients in search of live musicians for hire.
Developed as a final team project during a Bootcamp in Web development, I continued working on the project to add the design, the authentication and a connection to a MongoDB cluster following best practices with React to have a fully deployeable app.

Tools: MERN stack
 MongoDB Atlas cluster, Express, React 16.8+ Hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext, useReducer, useRef), CSS and Bootstrap, JWT (JSON Web Token) for authentication, Node.
